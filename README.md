# WordleGameCB
WordleGameCB is a game inspired by the Wordle word game developed by Josh Wardle. This application was developed with the aim of putting into practice React concepts such as the use of **Hooks, Custom Hooks and States.** In addition, the use of new technologies: ***Tailwinds as CSS Framework and Vite as a file packer, an alternative to WebPack.***

## Features
**- Input Bar(Text Field)** : By typing the name of the pokemon and pressing enter we can perform a search in the API and display the data of this in case it is found.   
**- Card** : The game takes place inside a card with minimalist styles and dark design. 
**- Responsive** : As it is a vertically and horizontally centered design set it became easy to apply responsive parameters for smaller screens.
**- Effects** : Effects or animations are added as a result of losing or winning the game, in order to represent the state in which we find ourselves.
